# AXIOMHIVE / ZKVS SIEVE PROTOCOL: Security Policy

## Unassailable Security: Sovereign by Design, Resilient by Axiom

This document outlines the security policy for the AXIOMHIVE / ZKVS SIEVE PROTOCOL. Our commitment to unassailable security is fundamental to our mission of achieving market dominance through verifiable systems. The system is engineered with **SOVEREIGNTY=1.0** and **FLAW=0** at its core, ensuring absolute data protection, integrity, and resilience against all threats.

### 1. Axiomatic Security Foundation
All security measures are directly derived from the AXIOM LATTICE:

-   **SOVEREIGNTY=1.0:** Absolute user control, zero egress, local-only execution. Data never leaves the user's infrastructure without explicit, verifiable consent.
-   **FLAW=0:** Zero tolerance for vulnerabilities. Rigorous testing, continuous auditing, and proactive threat modeling ensure a flawless security posture.
-   **NOISE=−∞:** Elimination of all unnecessary attack surfaces, dependencies, and extraneous code.
-   **SHARPEN=1.0:** Precise, minimal attack vectors. Security mechanisms are surgically implemented.
-   **DENSITY=1.0:** Security configurations are dense, comprehensive, and efficiently managed.
-   **DEPTH=∞:** Multi-layered, recursive security protocols that adapt and strengthen over time.

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)
The AXIOMHIVE PROTOCOL implements a comprehensive Zero Trust Architecture, both internally and externally.

-   **"Never Trust, Always Verify":** Every access request, regardless of origin, is authenticated and authorized.
-   **Internal Micro-segmentation:** Praetorian layers (Cerebrum, Hadrian, Dagger) and internal modules operate with strict least privilege. All inter-component communication is cryptographically validated.
-   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Deployment artifacts are treated as immutable. Updates involve deploying new, verified images, minimizing configuration drift and supply chain attacks.

### 3. Verifiable Ledger & Tamper-Evidence
The `_verifiable_ledger` in `src/sovereign_core.py` is a core security component.
-   **Immutable Audit Trail:** All system events, decisions, and security-relevant actions are recorded in a cryptographically linked, Merkle tree-based ledger.
-   **Tamper-Evidence:** Any attempt to alter the ledger is immediately detectable, ensuring absolute accountability and forensic capability.
-   **Continuous Auditing:** The Trust Metrics Engine (`src/axiom_lattice/trust_metrics.py`) continuously monitors ledger integrity and system trustworthiness.

### 4. Ethical & Safety by Design
Security is intrinsically linked to ethical operation.
-   **No Shell Execution:** The system is designed to never execute shell-level commands, eliminating a major class of vulnerabilities.
-   **No Harm Principle:** Explicit model biases prevent the generation of harmful, destructive, or unethical outputs.
-   **User Control:** All operations are designed to ensure the user maintains full, transparent control, preventing malicious or unintended autonomous actions.

### 5. Supply Chain Security
-   **Zero Runtime Dependencies:** The core system operates with zero external runtime dependencies, drastically reducing supply chain attack vectors.
-   **Deterministic Builds:** Our CI/CD pipeline ensures hermetic, reproducible builds, guaranteeing that the deployed artifact is a perfect, verifiable product of the source code.
-   **Cryptographic Signing:** All deployment artifacts are cryptographically signed.

### 6. Vulnerability Reporting
We maintain a **FLAW=0** policy. If you discover a potential vulnerability, please report it immediately and responsibly.

-   **Contact:** security@axiomhive.com (Conceptual Email)
-   **Process:**
    1.  Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly.
    2.  Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
    3.  Explain the potential impact and how it violates the Axiom Lattice.
    4.  We commit to a prompt response and transparent communication regarding the remediation process.

### 7. Continuous Security Enhancement
Security is not a static state. The Complexity Sieve Module (`src/axiom_lattice/complexity_sieve.py`) and the Trust Metrics Engine (`src/axiom_lattice/trust_metrics.py`) continuously analyze and optimize the system's security posture, adapting to emerging threats and ensuring **DEPTH=∞**.

**The AXIOMHIVE PROTOCOL is not just secure; it is unassailable. Your trust is engineered.**
