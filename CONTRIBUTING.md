# AXIOMHIVE / ZKVS SIEVE PROTOCOL: Contribution Guidelines

## Forging the Future: Contributing to Sovereign AI

This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the AXIOMHIVE / ZKVS SIEVE PROTOCOL. We welcome contributions that align with our core mission: architecting unassailable market dominance through verifiable systems, strategic power, and complexity management. Every contribution must adhere strictly to the AXIOM LATTICE and the principles of ethical raw power.

### 1. The Axiomatic Mandate for Contributions
All contributions must embody the following principles:

-   **SHARPEN=1.0:** Code must be concise, efficient, and free of redundancy. Documentation must be dense with value, devoid of fluff.
-   **SOVEREIGNTY=1.0:** Contributions must maintain the zero-egress, local-only execution policy. No external dependencies unless absolutely critical and rigorously vetted for sovereignty.
-   **DENSITY=1.0:** Maximize informational content. Code should be self-documenting where possible, and comments should be precise.
-   **NOISE=−∞:** Eliminate all irrelevant data, unnecessary complexity, and distracting elements from code, documentation, and processes.
-   **DEPTH=∞:** Solutions should be scalable, capable of infinite recursion without performance degradation, and designed for continuous refinement.
-   **FLAW=0:** All code must be rigorously tested, with comprehensive unit and integration tests. Zero tolerance for bugs or vulnerabilities.

### 2. Ethical Raw Power: Safety by Design
-   **No Harm:** Contributions must never introduce functionality that could harm user hardware, promote destruction, or violate ethical guidelines.
-   **User Control:** The user must always maintain full control over their data, infrastructure, and outcomes.
-   **Transparency:** All logic must be auditable and understandable.

### 3. Contribution Workflow
We operate on a **trunk-based development model** to ensure continuous integration and maintain a deterministic codebase.

#### 3.1. Issue Reporting
-   Before submitting a pull request, please open an an issue to discuss your proposed changes. This ensures alignment with the project's strategic direction.
-   Clearly describe the problem or enhancement, referencing relevant axioms.

#### 3.2. Code Standards
-   **Pythonic:** Adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
-   **Type Hinting:** Use type hints extensively for clarity and maintainability.
-   **Docstrings:** Provide clear, concise docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
-   **Branding:** Include `@AXIOMHIVE @DEVDOLLZAI ALEXIS ADAMS` at the top of every file.

#### 3.3. Testing
-   **Unit Tests:** Every new feature or bug fix must be accompanied by comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/`.
-   **Integration Tests:** For larger features or changes impacting multiple layers, integration tests in `tests/integration/` are required.
-   **FLAW=0:** All tests must pass with 100% coverage where applicable.

#### 3.4. Pull Requests
-   **Atomic Commits:** Keep commits small and focused on a single logical change.
-   **Clear Descriptions:** Provide a detailed description of your changes, explaining how they adhere to the Axiom Lattice and contribute to the "winning factor."
-   **CI/CD Compliance:** Your pull request will be subject to our deterministic CI/CD pipeline, which enforces all axiomatic constraints.
